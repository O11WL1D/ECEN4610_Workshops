git installation:

1. install git on your computer
2. create a new folder where you want to add git repo.
3. navigate to this folder in your console, i.e. open console and type cd "path to repo folder "

type "git init" to initialize a new git repo in your folder.

type git config --global user.email  "youreMAILHEREE@gmail.com"  

this should be the email to your GitHub account.

type git config --global user.password "1234321"

this should be the password to your GitHub account. 

type git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
the link should be the link to the online repo. 

next, run the command, 
 
git fetch origin master

this should download everything from the repo

after updating any file in the GitHub, run the following commands:


git add .

git commit -m "default commit"

git push origin master


the text in the commit command is a message that you can change to reflect whatever you've done during the update, 
ideally this should not be default commit so that when you are debugging you can track the specific update which 
is giving you problems/you want to restore. 


if you have any questions, give me a holler.
